## Validation rules

- **Length**
	- Passwords must be at least 12 characters long â€” because short passwords are for amateurs.
- **Uppercase and Lowercase**
    - At least one uppercase and one lowercase letter are required. It's time to mix things up!
- **Digits**
    - A password must include at least one number. Let's add a numerical twist!
- **Special Characters**
    - Special characters like `@#$%^&+=!` are a must. Think of them as the frosting on a cake.
- **No Spaces**
    - Passwords with spaces? Not here.
- **No Repeated Sequences**
    - Repeated sequences of 3 or more characters are a no-go. Challenge accepted, right?
